# Aim of the project
Using Python, Dash and Plotly, I have developed an interactive two page web application comprising of pie chart,bar chart,treemap,data table, bar graph and scatter map which can be accessed by users to find insights from a csv dataset.

### app.py contains the main python code you'll need and style.css contains the styling css sheet 

Link for the dataset:

listing.csv.gz under Paris is the file you'll need to download and then attach it to your main directory in order to use the csv file
